            My love, words will never be enough to express how much you mean to me. Every moment with you is a blessing, 
            every smile of yours is a light in my life, and every heartbeat of mine beats for you. 
            You are not just beautiful on the outside but even more so in your heart. 
            I fall for you every single day, and I promise to cherish and love you endlessly. ❤️
